# SmartCalc

Description:
Implemented a calculator with trigonometric phenomena, substituting an X and drawing graphics
+ loan calculator

I used to write it in C. I wrote it in S++ using the MVC (Model – View – Controller) design pattern and solid principles. According to all this, all business logic (Model) is separated from the interface (View) and combined through an intermediary - the controller.

Functional:
- arithmetic operations
- trigonometric operations
- insert x
- drawing a graph
